  - Load balancing with multiple strategies (round-robin, random, weighted)
  - Hot reload with graceful connection draining
- **Observability System**:
  - Comprehensive metrics collection with per-plugin granularity
  - Structured logging with configurable log levels
  - Performance monitoring with latency tracking
  - Error categorization and reporting
  - Optional distributed tracing support
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
  - Plugin factory pattern for dynamic instantiation

  - Extensive test coverage with benchmarks
- **Go Generics Support**: Type-safe plugin interfaces using Go 1.24+ generics

### Technical Details
- **Minimum Go Version**: 1.24 (required for latest dependencies)
- **Dependencies**:
  - `github.com/agilira/go-errors v1.1.0` for enhanced error handling
  - `github.com/agilira/go-timecache v1.0.1` for high-performance time operations
  - `google.golang.org/grpc v1.75.1` for gRPC transport
  - `golang.org/x/net` for advanced networking features
- **Architecture**: Thread-safe with atomic operations and mutex-protected critical sections
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput scenarios with minimal allocations

### Security
- Secure defaults for all authentication methods
- Input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data
- Protection against common attack vectors (path traversal, injection attacks)
- Comprehensive audit logging for security-sensitive operations

## Version History

- **v1.0.0** (2025-01-15): Initial release with comprehensive plugin system
- **Unreleased**: Ongoing improvements and community feedback integration

## Migration Guide

### From Other Plugin Systems

When migrating from other Go plugin systems:

1. **Interface Adaptation**: Implement the `Plugin[Req, Resp]` interface
2. **Transport Configuration**: Choose appropriate transport (HTTP/gRPC/Unix)
3. **Authentication Setup**: Configure authentication method if required
4. **Observability Integration**: Enable metrics and logging as needed

### Breaking Changes

This is the initial release, so no breaking changes yet. Future versions will document any breaking changes here with migration instructions.
